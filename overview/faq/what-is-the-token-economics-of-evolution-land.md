# What is the token economics of Evolution Land?

## **What is RING?**

RING is the system token in Evolution Land, which serves as the unit of pricing and the base currency in the game. It will be used to pay for operational fees and smart contract fuels in the Evolution Land system and network. The trading and purchase of various element resources, lands, buildings and props will also use RING as the unit of pricing, which is the most liquid currency in the game. To speak frankly, it’s the money in the game. Players may get RING from work or sale of resources, which can be used to purchase the required supplies. System revenue of the game is also allocated by RING.

## **What is KTON?**

KTON is a proof of liquidity lock, and a proof of equity. Users need to lock RING into the Gringotts Bank for a certain period of time to get KTON, which is a bit similar to the interest on bank’s time deposits. This is actually an algorithm of the equity-based PoW: based on how long you promise to hold the token in the future. 30% of the game’s system revenue will be distributed to KTON holders.

## **What is COO?**

COO is a highly-available resource in the game, which is similar to the oxygen we breathe. In the context of the Evolution Land, the apostle \(the player's in-game identity\) needs COO to survive. Users can get the resource through some simple operations such as logging in to the game frequently. Many of the primary activities in the game only need COO.
