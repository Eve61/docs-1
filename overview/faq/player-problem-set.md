## **Why I am missing lottery points when I bought bid land?**

Because of the unstable event monitoring service, sometimes the page will not be displayed in time even if the lottery points are successfully acquired.

We recommend you to enter the lottery page to check your points, where shows you the latest accurate ones.

## **Three apostles born were supposed to have enhancements on soil, enhancements payments were deducted from soil balance, but they were born plain, without any enhancements, what are the percentages to get enhancements, for each payment tier? If i pay 5 soil, what chance?** 

Enhancement is random, like lottery.

Pay 5 elements: 50%-lv1, 50%-0

Pay 10 elements: 50%-lv1, 50%-lv2

Pay 15 elements: 25%-lv1, 50%-lv2, 25%-lv3

## What's "History" and "Channel records"?

"**History**" records the transaction on chain which happened on the Evolution Land, including Bancor trading, lottery, auction bid/claim/sell of the land and etc,.

**"Channel records"** records the transaction directly assigned to the player by the system which is not on chain, mainly including KTON division, airdrop, reward and etc. The RING in the record is stored in the “unclaimed”, and the players can claim them to use.

## **What is the use of the mined elements?**

Similar to the real world, all economic activities, production and construction are centered around resources. Props, architectures, and researches require different types of element resources. For now, you can add element preferences \(in consumption of resources\) to the new apostles to increase the efficiency of the apostle's mining of such elements.
