2. If other players enter the auction through your link, you will get a reward when their bidding is successful.

3. The amount of reward you receive is 20% of the official fee charged.

#### **Case Analysis**

\(1\) Player A is the first one who bid the land , he/she cost 1000 RING.

\(2\) Player B participates in the auction through the link shared by Player C and successfully bids with 1100 RING.

\(3\) After Player B bid successfully, let's look at the Tokens Transfered information:

There are 5 transactions in Tokens Transfered, from top to bottom:

Transaction 1:   Player B to Contract: 1101 RING

Transaction 2： Contract to player B: 1 RING

Transaction 3： Contract to land holder: 48 RING

Transaction 4： Contract to player A: 1048 RING

Transaction 5： Contract to player C: 0.8 RING

Explanation of the transaction 1 and transaction 2:

Player B give 1101 RING to the contract , because in the actual transaction, in order to allow the player to bid successfully, the system requires the price to be 10 minutes later. The extra part will be returned to the player, that is, the contract 2 to the player B 1 RING.
