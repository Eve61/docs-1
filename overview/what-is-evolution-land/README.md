# What is Evolution Land

## **What's the Evolution Land?**

Evolution Land is a virtual simulation blockchain game that supports cross-chain transactions. The game has 26 continents, each of which is deployed on a different public chain. The governance parameters, such as the trade tax rate, will be set by users themselves. Users can buy and sell the land and have apostles to mine various elements, constructions, and manufacture props, etc. Apostles may have offspring to inherit their genes and improve their ability by upgrading the equipment and talent. There is a miner in career choices and architecture, musician, doctor, and many others. Different continents will evolve into foreign countries, and there will be trades and wars between the countries through our cross-chain technology.

Evolution Land integrates a variety of gameplays, including management, collection, education, gene, battle, auction, and game, which will constantly be evolving.

Evolution Land has deployed its first continent of Atlantis on Ethereum, with functions including trading of lands and apostles, working, mining, and breeding launched. The Byzantine, its second continent, will be deployed on TRON in the near future.

## **Gameplays**

**Collectives:** There are unique features and as many as ten talents determined by genes for the limited original apostles. Users may have the apostles breeding for rare apostles with advanced genetic variation.â€Œ

**Education:** The apostle's talented ability allows each of them to have their own right to work or fight and make him or her superb through education.

**Trading:** Trading land, hiring workers, constructing or conducting scientific research will bring you greater social impact and economic success. You may collect more mineral resources for higher levels.

**Career:** In addition to the miner's career ner that has already been launched, Evolution Land offers more career choices and corresponding social roles such as warrior, doctor, musician, etc. Each apostle can find his or her right place.

**Battle:** PvE, PvP, siege, group warfare, and the national war between the continents are about to be launched. If you have a love for blazing a trail, join the game to form your army.

**Play to Earn:** 70% of the game's revenue will be shared with the players; whether you are a KTON holder or active in construction, you may share the game's success. Even if you are playing the game for fun, you can win huge prizes through a transaction lottery.

## **Technical Features**

**On-chain Game and Contract Operation:** Ownership of the game assets is confirmed by public blockchain technology. The players themselves own the identity accounts and game assets such as tokens and props. Almost the entire logic of the game is deployed on the blockchain in a contractual form. There is no need for players to worry about the common drawbacks of traditional games such as pulling strings, additional issuance, and plug-ins. The development team can't make shady deals.

**Cross-Chain Token Economy:** The world's first cross-chain token economy system with game scenes, different continents deployed on a different public chain, token, and assets can be exchanged in other continents through the Darwinia Network, constituting a free-market economy in a purely digital world.

**Decentralized Autonomy:** Evolution Land is designed to be a self-evolving, scalable, and open system. The players holding KTON have the right to vote on the continent's autonomous parameters and the right to speak in the direction of the game's evolution. All members of the DAO community will determine the game rules to enable the game itself to evolve on its own, ensuring that each user is both a player and a game designer.

**Open and Borderless:** With the open interfaces, SDK, and on-chain contracts of Evolution Land, any developer can easily build their own Dapp on the Evolution Land to integrate into the economic system and benefit from built-in referrals, sharing, and many other incentives. Simultaneously, traditional game assets, third-party Dapp, ERC721 assets, etc., can be seamlessly linked in. Evolution Land will evolve with the development of technology.
