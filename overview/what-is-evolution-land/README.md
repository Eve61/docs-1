# What is Evolution Land

## **What's the Evolution Land ?**

Evolution Land is a virtual simulation blockchain game that supports cross-chain transactions. The game has a total of 26 continents, each of which is deployed on a different public chain. The governance parameters, such as trade tax rate, will be set by users themselves.

There are not only miner in career choices, but also architecture, musician, doctor and many others. Different continents will evolve into different countries, and there will be trades and wars between the countries through our cross-chain technology.

On-chain Game and Contract Operation：Based on the mainstream public blockchains, ownership of the game assets is confirmed by the tracking of blockchain technology. The identity accounts and game assets such as tokens and props are owned by the players themselves. Almost the entire logic of the game is deployed on the blockchain in a contractual form. There is no need for players to worry about the common drawbacks of traditional games such as pulling strings, additional issuance, and plug-ins. The development team can't make shady deals.

Cross-Chain Token Economy：The world’s first cross-chain token economy system with game scenes, different continent deployed on a different public chain, token and assets can be exchanged in different continent through Darwina chain，constituting a free-market economy in a purely digital world.

Decentralized Autonomy：Evolution Land will be designed to be a self-evolving, scalable and open system. The players holding KTON has the right to vote on the continent's autonomous parameters, as well as the right to speak in the direction of the game evolution. The rules of the game will be determined by all members of the DAO community to enable the game itself to evolve on its own, making sure that each user is both a player and a game designer.

Open and Borderless：With the open interfaces, SDK and on-chain contracts of Evolution Land, any developer can easily build their own Dapp on the Evolution Land to integrate into the economic system, and benefit from built-in referrals, sharing and many other incentives. At the same time, traditional game assets, third-party Dapp, ERC721 assets, etc. can be seamlessly linked in. Evolution Land will evolve with the development of technology.
