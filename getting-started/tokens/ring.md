# RING

## Usage

In Evolution Land, RING is used as currency to pay for service fees, trading taxes. Likewise, trading various resources, lands, buildings, and props will also use the RING as the accounting unit. Game revenue sharing is also distributed in RING. In short, the RING is the money; players use it to pay for services and taxes, buy goods, and receive payroll.

## Background of RING 

RING is the native token of the Darwinia Network. Evolution Land, as the flagship dApp, is using RING as an in-game currency. RING resides in various blockchain networks in different token specifications. On Ethereum, RING follows ERC20 spec, on TRON, RING follows TRX20 spec, and on Darwinia Network, RING stays as a native token. The initial supply of RING is 2 billion (all RING on various blockchain network sum up). Due to the Darwinia Network's nature being a cross-chain bridge hub chain, RING and other tokens can move between blockchains in a decentralized fashion.  Check out this doc for [more information](https://docs.darwinia.network/docs/en/wiki-us-tokens) about RING on Darwinia Network's documentation site.

RING is inflated at a rate of around 5% by the Darwinia Network to pay validators and nominators for validating and producing blocks. RING has a hard cap of 10 billion to be reached in 50 years at the current rate.
