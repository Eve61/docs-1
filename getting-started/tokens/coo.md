# COO

## 什么是COO?

COO，（即碳氧，英文全称： Evolution Land Carbon Dioxide）数量无上限，是一种初级消费货币。

## COO的价值

COO可以购买低级别任务的执行和道具，使游戏早期用户，可以无需花费真金白金即可进行游戏。但是随着进程推进，更上层的操作则无法仅使用碳氧进行。

## 我该如何获取COO？

1. 购买创世宝箱赠送（已售罄）。
2. 用户可通过小工作量活动获得，比如每日登录、参与社区活动等。

## COO可以链上交易吗？

COO无法转移/转让，只能在游戏内进行消费。


COO is a highly-available resource like the oxygen we breathe. In the Evolution Land context, the [Apostle](/getting-started/game-entities/apostle) \(the player's in-game representative\) needs some COO to survive on the planet. Users can get the resource through some simple operations such as login into the game frequently. Many of the game's primary activities require only some COO, mainly for some players looking for fun or for those who come around to experience the game.

## Can COO be traded on the blockchain?

No, COO can't be traded on the blockchain, and they can't be transferred. It can only be consumed in the game.
