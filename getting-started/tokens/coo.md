# COO

## **What's COO?**

COO is a highly-available resource like the oxygen we breathe. In the context of the Evolution Land, the apostle \(the player's in-game representative\) needs COO to survive on the planet. Users can get the resource through some simple operations such as log in to the game frequently. Many of the primary activities in the game require only COO, which is mainly for some players looking for fun, or for those who come around for a chance to experience the game.

## **How to get COO?**

1. Purchase a Treasure Chest \(sold out\).

2. Users can get COO through small workload activities, such as daily login, participate in community activities, and so on.

## **Can COO be traded on the blockchain?**

Sorry, COO can't be traded on the blockchain. COO can't be transferredï¼Œand it can only be consumed in-game.
