# COO

COO is a highly-available resource like the oxygen we breathe. In the Evolution Land context, the [Apostle](/getting-started/game-entities/apostle.md) (the player's in-game representative) needs some COO to survive on the planet. Users can get the resource through some simple operations such as login into the game frequently. Many of the game's primary activities require only some COO, mainly for some players looking for fun or for those who come around to experience the game.

## **How to get COO?**

1. Purchase a Treasure Chest \(sold out\).

2. Users can get COO through small workload activities, such as daily login, participate in community activities, and so on.

## **Can COO be traded on the blockchain?**

No, COO can't be traded on the blockchain, and they can't be transferred. It can only be consumed in the game.
