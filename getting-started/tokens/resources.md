# Resources

**There are five basic resources on Evolution Land: GOLD, WOOD, HHO, FIRE, and SIOO.**

Each land on the Evolution Land will continue to produce these resources, but due to the different properties of the land, the output rates and quantities of the various resources are different.

There are more gold near the mine, more wood near the forest, more water near the river, more fire near the volcano, more soil near the mountain.The meaning of more is that the speed of production is relatively fast, and the amount is relatively large.

These five resources are also five tokens. Building house or props will consume one or several kinds of these five resources.
