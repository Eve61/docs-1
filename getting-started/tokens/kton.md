# KTON

## 什么是KTON?

KTON（即氪石，英文全称: Evolution Land Kryptonite），是给予RING长期持有者和价值投资者的奖励，是一种流动性锁定证明，亦是权益凭证。

## KTON的价值？

KTON 可用于购买创世高价值地块、重要道具、及参与系统重要投票\(部分地块及道具等只能使用氪石购买\)。

同时KTON持有者将根据持有份额，获得系统收入的30%作为分成奖励。

## 我该如何获取KTON？

* 玩家可以在进化星球虚拟银行（即古灵阁）锁定RING来获取KTON，根据锁定RING的数量与锁定时间计算获得的KTON的数量。KTON 将于存入的同时，通过合约一次性完成发放。（目前仅支持在Darwinia主网进行锁定）
* 不想锁定自己的RING又想获得KTON？可以通过交易所直接购买其他用户生成并出售的KTON。

## 什么是KTON分成？

系统收入的30%发放给所有氪石持有者，作为RING长期持有者和价值投资者的奖励。氪石分成部分为持续发放，可以在氪石持有账户的状态通道中查看获取记录。


## Usage

In Evolution Land, KTON is used as **a governance token**. Players can voluntarily lock their KTON into a governance contract \(minimum 14 days lock time\) to receive voting power. These voting power can vote for governance proposals within the continent to affect the evolution of the game. In return, these "governor" players will have the right to receive game **revenue dividends** \(30% of all revenue\), proportionally to their stake percentage of all locked KTONs.

In the game, some high-value Lands, high-rank buildings, and props are priced in KTON.

## Background of KTON

KTON is introduced on the Darwinia Network. It's a commitment token, a symbol of tokenized commitment, from the Darwinia Network's advanced staking system. It encourages RING holders to lock RING for a longer time in exchange for KTON, which can be used in the staking system. Staking rewards are split into two equal pools for RING and KTON stakers. Check out this [medium article](https://darwinianetwork.medium.com/darwinia-commitment-token-kton-861e2df1b4cb) to find out more about the design rationale of KTON.

Due to KTON holders' nature being the long-term investors or those who would pay a premium to obtain this commitment, this demographic is suitable to be candidates of Evolution Land governance participants.
