# KTON

## **What is KTON?**

KTON is a proof of liquidity lock, and a proof of equity. Users need to lock RING into the Gringotts Bank for a certain period of time to get KTON, which is a bit similar to the interest on bank’s time deposits. This is actually an algorithm of the equity-based PoW: based on how long you promise to hold the token in the future. 30% of the game’s system revenue will be distributed to KTON holders.

## **Value of KTON**

KTON can be used to purchase some high-value lands, important props and participate in important system voting \(some lands and props can only be purchased using KTON\), while KTON holders will receive 30% of system revenue based on shareholding as KTON dividend.

## **How to get KTON?**

1. You can lock the RING in the Evolution Land Virtual Bank \( Gringotts \) to obtain KTON, and the number of KTON you obtained based on the number of locked RING and the time. KTON will be issued once at the same time as the deposit. The Gringotts deposit business is the only way KTON is issued.

2. Don't want to lock your RING and want to get KTON? You can purchase KTON generated and sold by other users at [otcmaker.com](https://www.otcmaker.com/) .

## **What's KTON Dividend?**

30% of system revenue \( RING \) is paid in proportion to all KTON holders as a reward for RING long-term holders and value investors. The RING obtained from KTON Dividend will be distributed in real time, and records can be viewed in the "Channel records" .
