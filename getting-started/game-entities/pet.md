## How to "Pet" ï¼Ÿ

EvolutionLand is introducing a new feature called "Pet".  It allows player to import ERC721 asset in foreign dApps into EvolutionLand as "Pet".  Player can use it's apostle \(user avatar\) to tame pet and the pet will be bound with the apostle physically and spiritually so that apostle's ability in various activities will be enhanced.  Right now, apostle's mining ability will be enhanced since this is the first and the only profession available. In future releases, apostles' fighting skills, healing abilities etc will be enhanced by carrying a pet as well.

The very first Pet will be from CryptoKitties.  More ERC721 sources will be added so that player have more choices. Player go to "My Pets" section and only CryptoKitties owned by player's address will be displayed and player are able to perform further "Tame" action.  Tame in technical sense, player is required to sign a transaction in which a mirror Crypto Kitty is generated and bind to player's apostle at choice. That requires to verify player is signing the tx using the same address as the Crypto Kitty's owner, which means you won't be able to tame other people's kitties.  EvolutionLand contract system will operate on this mirrored kitty instead of original kitty except one situation that is if player is going to sell it's mirrored kitty using auction. EvolutionLand will require player to transfer ownership of original kitty to auction contract to prevent mirrored and original kitty ending up with different owner.  Selling/buying pet is not enabled and will be introduced in later time.

Player also have the ability to "let go" the bound pet to revert the operation or simply trying to re-tame using a different apostle.

Below are simple screen shots of how to using "Pet" system.
