**Mystery: The elements of the land are hidden and will not be made public until the player has claimed. The player may purchase the land with the elemental output comparable to the reserved land at the price of the ordinary land.**

## **How to distinguish between official land and second-hand land?**

1. The simplest way to distinguish is based on color recognition, green with logo of Evolution Land  is the official land;

2. Some naughty players will upload the Evolution Land logo to pretend the official Land. In this case, you can distinguish between the official land and the second-hand land by this way: click on the land and view the details of the land. If you see that the owner of the land is EVE and the land has no transaction records, it is the “True official land”.
