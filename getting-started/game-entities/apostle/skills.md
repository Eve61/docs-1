## Talents

Apostles have gene-decided talent attributes, as shown in the image below. These talents decide how efficiently the Apostle can perform a task, that is, the base productivity. For example, when mining, `Strength` (the higher, the better) and `Intelligence` (the lower, the better) affect the base productivity much more than other talents. Various work or tasks requires different talent sets.

When switching occupations, a tuition fee must be paid for the profession training.  Each occupation will need different talent set to determine base productivity.  That is if an Apostle is bad at this, he/she might be good at some other work.  Then choose that occupation as his/her profession is a smart move.
